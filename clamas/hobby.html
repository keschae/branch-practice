            <p>High School: Collinsville High School  2011-2015</p>

            <p>When I first started going to ISU, I was an Actuarial Science major. I realized during my junior year that this wasn't what I wanted to do.
                 I decided to make the switch to Statistics because I wanted to make sure I still graduated on time. During my Senior year, I finally stopped and thought about what
                I actually wanted to do with my life. I had taken IT 168 my freshman year as a requirement for my major and enjoyed it a lot. I have
                always loved solving problems and coming up with solutions to them. I realized that coding was what I wanted to do, and so I made a
                switch to Computer Science and I am very happy that I did.</p>

            <h3>To Watch:</h3>
            <p>When it comes to shows, I like all kinds of things. I enjoy comedies, like: The Office, How I Met Your Mother, New Girl, and Brooklyn 99. I also 
                more serious shows, like: Criminal Minds, Supernatural, and Grey's Anatomy. Lately, I have started watching more anime too. I had only watched a few, like:
                Death Note, Soul Eater, and Attack on Titan. Recently, I started watching more, like: Naruto (regular Naruto and now Naruto Shippuden), The Promised Neverland,
                Yuri on Ice. I am hoping to watch some more, but it is hard to do with classes and work. As for movies, I love all kinds. I love action, like: The Matrix series and all of the
                Marvel Movies. I love fantasy, like: the whole Harry Potter series and Lord of the Rings. I love animated movies. My all time favorite animated movie is Cloudy with
                a Chance of Meatballs.

            <h3>To Do:</h3>
            <p>I enjoy watching TV when I can. I also really like to read. I like reading fiction. Lately, I have been reading more Mystery and Thriller books.
                I haven't had a lot of time to read lately with school and work, but I do enjoy it. When quarantine first started, I went out and bought a Nintendo 
                Switch. I like to play Animal Crossing, Donkey Kong, and Super Mario. I have started playing some PC games. I enjoy playing Phasmophobia, Among Us, and Raft.
                I enjoy hanging out with friends when I can. It has gotten harder to do so with all of us being busy with school or work, but we make it work.

            <h3>To Listen:</h3>
            <p>I love all kinds of music. I like pop, rock, alternative, and country. My favorite artist is the band Mayday Parade. I love all of their music.
                I listen to music in many languages. I listen to Spanish, Korean, and sometimes Japanese. My music tastes are very diverse. Before Covid happened, I used to 
                go to concerts all of the time. I always had so much fun singing along to the music, almost to the point of losing my voice. I would try to attend as many
                concerts as I could. I have traveled all over for concerts too. I have gone as close as Bloomington for a concert, as well as Canada for a concert. The trips
                themselves are always a blast and I have a lot of good memories from them.
